# emailMachineSample
The given python program is a command line tool that I created to help automate the email sending process for my small online business (LockSplitr.com). Given the influx of emails sometimes received regarding my services along with the general repetition of most of the emails I receive, this was created to both save time and to help make my work flow more efficient and effective.  I share this tool not only as a portfolio piece, but as well I share this  with the intention of helping others create their own automated email sending tool. Within the program, I created a series of comments outlining the general functionality of the program itself, and how to maneuver around it and modify it to your personal liking and preference.
